          <dd>“Perfect location by the water. You can swim from the bar. Close to restaurants. Something going on here every night. Perfect for the party-traveler. Good common areas. I went on their wonderful bioluminescent water-tour one night and it was one of the highlights of my whole trip i Costa Rica and Panama. Very easy to meet people here.”</dd>

        <dd>“Very friendly couple with great attitude and mindset. Free equipment so you can do lots of things while saving money. We had booked a room for a week and got a free upgrade to a bungalow and that was just amazing! Our stay would've been awesome without that but their bungalows are brand new, super spacious and you'll never want to leave. It's a paradise to rent, with a gorgeous view in the midst of mother nature. Easy walk to Wizard beach and nature reserve. Affordable boat trips to close by places, great advice on tours and how to save money. Would fully recommend this place! ” </dd>
